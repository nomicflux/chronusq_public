Must have cmake version >= 2.8 to build this project

The first thing that must be compiled is the Libint library
(see DEPENDS). The easy way to to this (from the chronusq
dir) is to run the script:

  util/buildlibint NPROC

where NPROC is the number of processors you wish to compile
with. This will place files in the nesecary place for use
with ChronusQ. If Libint is already installed elsewhere,
you must passify the CMakeLists.txt in the chronusQ directory
by changing the location of the Libint library (this will
be done automatically eventually, but development has not reached
that point yet)


To build the easy way (from top chronusq dir):
  util/runconfig_<COMPILER_SUITE>[_OPTION1[_OPTION2[...]]]

Currently supported COMPILER_SUITE variables:
  gcc :  GNU compilers

Currently suppored OPTION variables:
  openmp : enable OpenMP threads (currently only threading available)
  libint : enable libint integrals (must be enabled!)

Scripts for pgi and intel are also included, but they aren't functional unless
libint has been compiled with the respective compiler
